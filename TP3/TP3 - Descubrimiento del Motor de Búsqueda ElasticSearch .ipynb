    "    'Resumen': 'Strengthening critical thinking abilities of citizens in the face of news published on the web represents a key challenge for education. Young citizens appear to be vulnerable in the face of poor quality news or those containing non-explicit ideologies. In the field of data science, computational and statistical techniques have been developed to automatically collect and characterize online news media in real time. Nevertheless, there is still not a lot of interdisciplinary research on how to design data exploration platforms supporting an educational process of critical citizenship. This article explores this opportunity through a case study analyzing critical thinking ability of students when facing news dealing with the social mobilization \"No+APF\". From data collected through 4 online exercises conducted by 75 secondary school students. 55 university students and 25 communication specialists, we investigate to what extent young citizens are able to classify news headiness and ideological orientation of news media outlets. We also question the influence of the media is brand name and the subjectivity of each participant in regards to the social mobilization \"No+APF\". The results underline the importance of group work, the influence of the brand name and the correlation between critical-thinking abilities and having a defined opinion.',\n",

    "    'Resumen':'Increased production of commodities in Latin America has transformed the rural landscape with a potential loss of cultural ecosystem services (CES). The aim of our study was to assess the extent and mechanisms by which the agriculturisation process in Balcarce County in the Pampas region of Argentina has affected the supply of CES of the rural landscape and consequently, the well-being of local inhabitants. Data were obtained through exploratory interviews with selected inhabitants of Balcarce County (Argentina). We focused on people is perceptions regarding landscape changes in the last two decades and the rural landscape aspects that provide identity, sense of place and cultural heritage. Interviews were qualitatively analyzed through content analysis. Results showed that twenty years ago the landscape sustained food provision along with CES. Agriculturisation has implied an undeniable increase of commodity production (i.e. soybean) and economic benefits at the expense of a significant loss of natural environments and changes in the rural livelihoods that sustain CES. The sierras (low mountains) emerge as the last remnants of natural environments sustaining identity, sense of place and cultural heritage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.',\n",

    "    'Resumen':'Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an exciting opportunity to monitor crop fields with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing capable of improving water stress management in agriculture. In this study, we reviewed the application of different types of UAVs using different remote sensors and compared their performance with ground-truth plant data. Several reflectance indices, such as NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI and PRInorm obtained from UAVs have shown positive correlations related to water stress indicators such as water potential (psi) and stomata] conductance (g(s)). Nevertheless, they have performed differently in diverse crops; thus, their uses and applications are also discussed in this study. Thermal imagery is also a common remote sensing technology used to assess water stress in plants, via thermal indices (calculated using artificial surfaces as references), estimates of the difference between canopy and air temperature, and even canopy conductance estimates derived from leaf energy balance models. These indices have shown a great potential to determine field stress heterogeneity using unmanned aerial platforms. It has also been proposed that chlorophyll fluorescence could be an even better indicator of plant photosynthesis and water use efficiency under water stress. Therefore, developing systems and methodologies to easily retrieve fluorescence from UAVs should be a priority for the near future. After a decade of work with UAVs, recently emerging technologies have developed more user-friendly aerial platforms, such as the multi-copters, which offer industry, science, and society new opportunities. Their use as high-throughput phenotyping platforms for real field conditions and also for water stress management increasing temporal and resolution scales could improve our capacity to determine important crop traits such as yield or stress tolerance for breeding purposes.
